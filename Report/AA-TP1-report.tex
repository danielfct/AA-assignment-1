\section{Introduction}
WHAT WE INITIALLY HAD,\\
WHAT WAS ASKED TO DO,\\
HOW WE PLAN ON DOING IT\\

\section{Classifiers}

Explain what are the three parameters that were optimized and their effects on their respective classifiers. This will also require a brief explanation of how each classifier works.\\
Explain the method by which the optimal values were found, noting the differences between the errors and the importance of leaving out a test set for the final evaluation\\
The report should show the error plots but no other plots are necessary\\

\large Logistic Regression\\

\large K-nearest Neighbours \\

\large Naive Bayes\\

\section{Comparation}

\large McNemar's test
TALK ABOUT WHAT IS MCNEMAR TEST AND HOW IT WAS IMPLEMENTED AND USED\\
Estimate the true error for each classifier, compare the classifiers with McNemar's test and discuss which, if any, is better for this application\\


\section{Conclusion}
WHAT WAS ACHIEVED AND WHAT WE LEARNT\\
